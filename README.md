# Introduction
The motivation for creating this repository was to share scripts, lookup tables and templates that are needed for translating point count data into the WildTrax upload format. This document serves as a step-by-step guide for how to bring data into BAM's network of datasets that are uploaded to WildTrax. In other words, a cradle-to-WildTrax story of avian count data.

The avian count data intake process involves six main steps (numbered 0-5). Here, we introduce each step with text. When naming of projects, datasets, or files must occur, you will see *file naming protocol:* within each step. Please follow these file naming protocols precisely so that BAM can easily track and find all information easily and as needed. 

0. Identifying avian count data.

1. Communicating with the data contributor.

2. Acquiring a data sharing agreement.

3. Acquiring source data and related documentation that facilitates revormatting (step 4, below).

4. Reformatting the data for WildTrax.

5. Uploading the data to WildTrax.


# 0. Identifying avian count data.
The first main objective of the Boreal Avian Modelling Project (hereafter, BAM), is to assemble, harmonize, and archive standardized bird survey data. See more [here](https://borealbirds.ualberta.ca/about-us/vision-mission-values/). 

**What kind of data does BAM assemble, harmonize, and archive?**

The BAM project gratefully accepts avian point-count data from studies conducted within the boreal and hemiboreal regions of North America. BAM [harmonizes](https://borealbirds.ualberta.ca/data-harmonization/) avian count data to produce models of [bird densities & population estimates](https://borealbirds.ualberta.ca/bird-densities/), that are applied in a variety of [collaborative projects](https://borealbirds.ualberta.ca/projects/).

To find original count datasets, BAM... (maybe TD can offer a general statement of how most of the data we use has been collected?). BAM also reaches out to potential data contributors when they become aware of projects (e.g., through reading scientific and grey literature) that may have count data from boreal and hemiboreal regions of North America.

If you have count data that you might want to contribute to BAM's projects, please [contact](mailto:borealavianmodellingproject@ualberta.ca?subject=[GitHub]%20Count%20Data%20Contribution) BAM to discuss possible data contributions. To discuss contributing data from autonomous recording units (ARUs), please [contact](http://bioacoustic.abmi.ca/job-opportunities/contact/) the Bioacoustic Unit.

# 1. Communicating with the data contributor

The majority of our communication  with data partners is by email. Although, many collaborations begin with in-person conversations at meetings. 

************* MM editing here (taking a breaK0. When a discussion with a potential data contributor takes place, a All email communication as a pdf and store it into the respective data folder in the BAM Shared Google Drive under "communication". An email template should be found in Template directory. 


# 2. Acquiring a data sharing agreement. 

A template of Sharing agreement should be found in Template. In WildTrax, sharing can be either:

1. **Published - Private**  - The project data will only be available to project members. Users will need to request access to the project in order to view any details such as species or locations.
2. **Published - Map Only** - The project data will be accessible through Data Discover but the media and report are not accessible to users who are not project members. If you're not a project or organization member, the location buffering and visibility settings will apply.
3. **Published - Map + Report Only** - (not for point counts) The project data become available to all WildTrax users through Data Downloads and Data Discover, however, the media is not accessible. Use this setting if you want to make your data publicly available but there are privacy concerns with your media. If you're not a project or organization member, the location buffering and visibility settings will apply.
4. **Published - Public** - The project data become available to any WildTrax user as well as the details of the project in Data Downloads and Data Discover. If you're not a project or organization member, the location buffering and visibility settings will apply.

(Note that you can also use **Active** status for projects that are currently being processed, designed or are in the preliminary stages of data uploading. Use this status if the project is actively being worked on. This is the default project status when it is first created.)

You need to make sure the communication reflects these options.


# 3. Acquiring source data and related documentation that facilitates revormatting (step 4, below).

All data acquired should be logged in the [template](https://github.com/MelinaHoule/WT-Integration/blob/345282009ddcbd465f07789eca1cc0b8ba78e13a/project_Integration.xlsx) as soon as you receive it. 

* Make sure the Organization exists. If not, create an entry.
* Create a new project entry. Marked it as NS (Not Started). 
* Create a new PartnerContactInfo entry for the project

If you don't intend to process the data straight away, make sure you overview the data to document some attributes, have all tables that define attributes and values used. Some information will be answered by emails. Make sure you keep a copy by converting the email as a PDF and make it available in the respective project folder under "communication". 

Overviewing the data includes:
* Observations have XY coordinates.
* Reference system of the coordinates is known.
* Protocol is documented (can be a report, email exchange, or found in the db itself).
* Species code definition is present. We cannot assume the species code used is the same as the one used by WildTrax. We need to check.
* If behaviour data are present, make sure we have the meaning of the values.
* Date and time is present.
* Abundance is present.

# 4. Reformatting the data for WildTrax.
Reformating will be unique per project. Some projects will use rules that are similar. All scripts are available to allow reusing chunk of codes. 

An example of the expected upload format for the point count and definition of attributes are found under [template](https://github.com/MelinaHoule/WT-Integration/tree/main/template).


# 5. Uploading the data to WildTrax.
