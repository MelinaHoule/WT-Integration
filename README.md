# Directory Structure

The Data intake process involve five main steps:

* Communication with data contributor.
* Acquire sharing agreement
* Acquire source data and related documentation to allow reformatting.
* Reformat the data.
* Upload data to WildTrax.


# Communication with data contributor

Communication  with data partners are generally by email. When relevant, save email communication as a pdf and store it into the respective data folder under communication. Email template should be added in Template directory 


# Sharing Agreement

A template of Sharing agreement should be found in Template. In WT, sharing can be either:

1. **Published - Private** The project data will only be available to project members. Users will need to request access to the project in order to view any details such as species or locations.
2. **Published - Map Only** The project data will be accessible through Data Discover but the media and report are not accessible to users who are not project members. If you're not a project or organization member, the location buffering and visibility settings will apply.
3. **Published - Map + Report Only** (not for point counts) The project data become available to all WildTrax users through Data Downloads and Data Discover, however, the media is not accessible. Use this setting if you want to make your data publicly available but there are privacy concerns with your media. If you're not a project or organization member, the location buffering and visibility settings will apply.
4. **Published - Public** In Published - Public all of the project data become available to any WildTrax user as well as the details of the project in Data Downloads and Data Discover. If you're not a project or organization member, the location buffering and visibility settings will apply.

(Note that you can also use **Active** status for projects that are currently being processed, designed or are in the preliminary stages of data uploading. Use this status if the project is actively being worked on. This is the default project status when it is first created.)

You need to make sure the communication reflect these options.


# Acquire source data and related documentation to allow reformatting

All data acquired should be logged in the [project_Integration file](https://github.com/MelinaHoule/WT-Integration/blob/345282009ddcbd465f07789eca1cc0b8ba78e13a/project_Integration.xlsx). 

* Make sure the Organization exists. If not, 
* Acquire sharing agreement
* Acquire source data and related documentation to allow reformatting.
* Reformat the data.
* Upload data to WildTrax.
